A simple job application tracker/logger. Users can enter basic application data and add it to a list. Building this application to pracice my skills in javascript, html and css along with exposing myself to backend work with Firebase Data storage. 

This app is tailored to how i like to log applications. 


Future Updates: 

- Ability to edit logged data
- Ability to change Current job application status and have visual feedback to reflect status change
- Link the program to a backend service. Firebase Storage will be first choice. 
- More UI Edits

Enjoy:)
